## Building from Source

Follow these steps to build the QtWin library from the source code.

### Prerequisites

- A C++17 compliant compiler (e.g., MSVC 2019+, GCC 9+, Clang 9+)

- CMake (version 3.16 or newer)

- Qt (version 6.2 or newer)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/locked-fog/QtWin.git
cd QtWin
```

2. Create a build directory and configure the project using CMake. This is the standard out-of-source build practice.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

3. Run CMake to generate the build files.

  - If Qt is in your system's PATH or a standard location:

  ```bash
  cmake..
  ```

  - If Qt is installed in a custom location, you must tell CMake where to find it by setting `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` :

  ```bash
  # For Windows
  cmake.. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/Qt/6.5.3/msvc2019_64"
  
  # For Linux/macOS
  cmake.. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/your/Qt/6.5.3/gcc_64"
  ```

4. Compile the library:

```bash
cmake --build. --config Release
```

5. (Optional) Create a distributable package using CPack. This will generate a .zip (Windows) or .tar.gz (Linux/macOS) archive in the build directory.

```bash
cpack -G ZIP  # Or -G TGZ
```

## Using QtWin in Your Project

Once you have built and packaged QtWin, you can easily integrate it into your own CMake-based application.

1. **Install QtWin**: Unpack the archive generated by CPack (e.g., `QtWin-1.0.0-Windows.zip`) to a stable location on your system. This location will be your `<qtwin_install_dir>`.

2. **Configure Your Project's `CMakeLists.txt`**: In your application's `CMakeLists.txt`, use `find_package` to locate QtWin and `target_link_libraries` to link against it.

```CMake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(MyAwesomeApp)

# Find dependencies
find_package(Qt6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Widgets)
find_package(QtWin 1.0.0 REQUIRED) # Find QtWin library

# Create your application target
qt_standard_project_setup()
qt_add_executable(MyAwesomeApp main.cpp)

# Link against QtWin
# This automatically handles include directories and other dependencies.
target_link_libraries(MyAwesomeApp PRIVATE QtWin::QtWin)
```

3. **Build Your Application**: When configuring your application with CMake, you must point `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to the directory where you installed QtWin. This allows `find_package` to locate the necessary configuration files (`QtWinConfig.cmake`).

```bash
# Create a build directory for your app
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure, pointing to both Qt and QtWin install locations if necessary
# (Separate paths with a semicolon on Windows, or a colon on Linux/macOS)
cmake.. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<path_to_qt_install>;<path_to_qtwin_install>"

# Build your application
cmake --build.
```
